# War-of-Nic
Hello, and thank you for downloading this game.
The game is simple, if you choose the war room you can attack or defend. You can also choose "detail" to see what divisions you have and recruit more.
You have a limit of 50 turns. The game starts out on turn 1.
There is also unrest to worry about.
You only have 5 Points to spare, however this can change temporarly due to events.

I really hope you enjoy it.
